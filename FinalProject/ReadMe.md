# Starbucks Capstone Challenge

## Overview

This repository is part of my Data Science Nanodegree Program with Udacity. The Starbucks Capstone Challenge is a project that simulates a real-world situation where Starbucks sends out offers to users and tracks their purchasing behavior. The goal is to analyze customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app and determine which demographic groups respond best to which type of offer.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to understand the factors that influence whether a customer will respond to an offer. By analyzing transactional data along with demographic information, I aim to provide insights that can help Starbucks tailor their offers to individual customer preferences, thereby increasing the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns.

## Files in the Repository

- `Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis, from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- `data/`: This folder contains the following datasets used in this project:
  - `portfolio.json`: Contains offer ids and metadata about each offer (duration, type, etc.).
  - `profile.json`: Demographic data for each customer.
  - `transcript.json`: Records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, the approach taken, and instructions on how to run the notebook.

## Libraries Used

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: For numerical computing.
- sklearn: For machine learning and predictive modeling.
- matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- seaborn: For making statistical graphics in Python.

## Results Summary

The analysis identified key patterns in customer behavior in response to different types of offers. The RandomForestClassifier model was able to predict with high accuracy which offers were most likely to be completed by different demographic groups. The results suggest that personalized offers based on customer data can significantly improve the effectiveness of promotional campaigns.

## Model Evaluation and Validation

The RandomForestClassifier was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets with a mixture of categorical and numerical features. The model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as metrics. Cross-validation was used to validate the model's performance, ensuring that the results were not due to overfitting or a particular data split.

## Justification

The final results showed that the RandomForestClassifier, with parameters tuned through grid search, performed well on the dataset. The cross-validation scores were consistently high, indicating that the model was able to generalize well to unseen data. A comparison of the model's performance with different parameter settings revealed that a higher number of trees (n_estimators) and a deeper tree (max_depth) led to better performance.

## How to Run

To run the Jupyter notebook, you will need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. Clone this repository, navigate to the project directory in your terminal, and run the following command to start JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

`bash

jupyter lab
or 
jupyter notebook

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into how different customers respond to various types of offers. The findings can help Starbucks create more effective marketing strategies by targeting the right offers to the right customers.
